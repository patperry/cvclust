I am pleased to accept "Estimating the number of clusters using
cross-validation", for publication in the Journal of Computational and
Graphical Statistics, subject to shortening the paper. I should have caught
this before but the paper is too long. Normally, a double-spaced paper is
under 30 pages. Yours is at about 45, which is far too long to be reasonable.
Much of this is possibly white-space, as tables are on separate pages, and
your page size seems to have a big bottom margin. I would recommend shifting
some material into the appendix, for example, the gene tables, and possibly
some of the slightly repetitive plots, or condensing those plots into a
smaller summary chart. I need to see a revision that is closer to 30 pages to
finally accept your paper
