Dear Prof. Dianne Cook and JCGS Associate Editors,

\vspace{1\baselineskip}

Wei Fu and I are submitting revision of Manuscript ID JCGS-17-028. We have
corrected the mistakes and added discussion of the points raised by the AE and
the reviewers. The Associate Editor and Reviewer 1 mostly requested more
discussion of some of the difficult issues in the paper; we have added these
as suggested. Reviewer 2 requested that we generalize our Propositions by
removing normality and dimensionality assumptions; we have done this, either
with a new proof in the appendix or with discussion of the assumption after
the relevant proof. (We kept the assumptions in the main text as-is for the
sake of clarity of presentation.) Reviewer~2 also asked for the results in
table form rather than as figures. We have added these tables in a
supplementary appendix.

Not counting the supplementary appendix for the tables, the revision added
8 pages of material to the manuscript.
