We are particularly interested in the use of this estimator for simultaneous variable selection and estimation. We show that under appropriate conditions, the SCAD-penalized least squares estimator is consistent for variable selection and that the estimators of nonzero coefficients have the same asymptotic distribution as they would have if the zero coefficients were known in advance. Simulation studies indicate that this estimator performs well in terms of variable selection and estimation.},

The popular leave-one-out cross-validation method, which is asymptotically equivalent to many other model selection methods such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Cp, and the bootstrap, is asymptotically inconsistent in the sense that the probability of selecting the model with the best predictive ability does not converge to 1 as the total number of observations n ? ?. We show that the inconsistency of the leave-one-out cross-validation can be rectified by using a leave-n?-out cross-validation with n?, the number of observations reserved for validation, satisfying n?/n ? 1 as n ? ?. This is a somewhat shocking discovery, because n?/n ? 1 is totally opposite to the popular leave-one-out recipe in cross-validation. Motivations, justifications, and discussions of some practical aspects of the use of the leave-n?-out cross-validation method are provided, and results from a simulation study are presented.},
